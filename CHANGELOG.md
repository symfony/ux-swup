# CHANGELOG

## 1.3

-   [DEPENDENCY CHANGE] `swup` (and a few themes/plugins) is no longer included
    automatically (#93), but `symfony/flex` will automatically add all the
    required libraries your `package.json` file when upgrading. Additionally
    `symfony/flex` 1.13 or higher is now required if installed.
